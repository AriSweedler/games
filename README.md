# hyperagent-web-apps

Four browser games, Gin Rummy, Fidice (one-cup liar's dice), Sheshbesh (backgammon: portes or
Western rules) and Briscola (the Italian trick-taking game for two, three or four), written in
strict functional TypeScript, built by Vite into static pages and served from two origins: GitHub Pages and a
Cloudflare Worker in front of it. Online play is peer-to-peer over WebRTC (PeerJS brokers the
handshake; a Cloudflare TURN relay carries the game when NAT blocks a direct path). Every push to
`main` and every PR is gated by typecheck, lint, unit and parity tests, dist guards and a two-peer
Playwright game on both emulated origins; a nightly plays the deployed pages for real.
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the layout and its rules; `docs/MIGRATION.md` records how two single-file
pages got here.

## Play

| Game                         | GitHub Pages                                                           | games.sweedler.com                                                               | Source                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Gin Rummy                    | https://arisweedler-at.github.io/hyperagent-web-apps/games/gin-rummy/  | https://games.sweedler.com/gin-rummy/                                            | `web/games/gin-rummy/`  |
| Fidice (one-cup liar's dice) | https://arisweedler-at.github.io/hyperagent-web-apps/games/fidice/     | https://games.sweedler.com/fidice/                                               | `web/games/fidice/`     |
| Sheshbesh (backgammon)       | https://arisweedler-at.github.io/hyperagent-web-apps/games/backgammon/ | https://games.sweedler.com/backgammon/ and https://games.sweedler.com/sheshbesh/ | `web/games/backgammon/` |
| Briscola                     | https://arisweedler-at.github.io/hyperagent-web-apps/games/briscola/   | https://games.sweedler.com/briscola/                                             | `web/games/briscola/`   |

Both origins serve the same `dist/`. `games.sweedler.com` is the Cloudflare Worker in
`infra/games-proxy/`: `/gin-rummy/`, `/fidice/`, `/backgammon/` and `/briscola/` are the short URLs, `/games/<name>/`
redirects to them and `/shared/...` maps to the site's `shared/` directory. Sheshbesh answers to two
names: `/sheshbesh/` is the backgammon page served in place by the Worker, and on GitHub Pages
`games/sheshbesh/` forwards to `games/backgammon/`; only `/backgammon/` is linked from the landing
page. A host on one origin and a guest on the other still meet: peer ids carry no origin.

Sheshbesh plays portes (the Greek set's first game: no doubling cube, a gammon doubles) or Western
backgammon (the cube, the triple game, the Crawford rule) as a match to 1, 3, 5 or 7 points, on one
phone passed between two players or online, host-authoritative over the same peer sessions as gin
(`docs/design/backgammon-rules.md`, `docs/design/backgammon-board.md`).

Briscola plays plain briscola (40 Italian cards, no obligation to follow suit, the trump card under
the stock and drawn last) for two, three or four players, as one game of 120 points or a match to
two or three wins, with the running score always on the table, on one phone passed around the
table or online for two (three and four online follow with the N-seat rooms). The cards are card
packs chosen the way sound fonts are (`docs/design/card-packs.md`); every trick's outcome is one
engine event that is both its sound and its history row (`docs/design/briscola-sound-history.md`).
It is the first game booted through the shared shell alone (`docs/design/briscola.md`,
`docs/design/briscola-rules.md`, `docs/design/briscola-board.md`).

Online play works on one network, or behind friendly NATs, with STUN alone. Two devices both behind
NAT (a phone on cellular and a laptop on office Wi-Fi) need the TURN relay: the pages fetch
short-lived credentials from `https://turn.sweedler.com` (see "Online play"). Without them the
host's wait screen warns that no relay is configured and a cross-network join can fail. Once
connected, a toast says "Connected directly" or "Connected via relay".

## Develop

Node 22 (`.nvmrc`). TypeScript, ESLint (typescript-eslint strict, eslint-plugin-functional, import-x
boundaries), Prettier, vitest and Playwright, all pinned exactly in `package.json`.

```
npm ci                  # install; the `prepare` script also installs the git hooks
npm run check           # typecheck + lint + every unit suite + build + the site guards: the full gate
npm run check:affected  # typecheck + lint + only the suites your commits touch: what pre-push runs
npm run test:gin        # one suite (shared, shared-integration, gin, fidice, backgammon, briscola, site, harness)

Git hooks are plain files in `.githooks/`: `pre-commit` chains to the owner's template hook in
`.git/hooks/pre-commit` (big-file and trailing-whitespace prompts; it resolves the hook through
`--git-common-dir`, so linked worktrees reach it too) and `pre-push` runs `npm run check:affected`
(typecheck, lint, then the suites the pushed commits touch; `PRE_PUSH=full git push` runs the whole
`npm run check`, as does a checkout with no `origin/main`). `npm ci` installs them through
`prepare`; run `npm run hooks` again if `core.hooksPath` was changed.

`package-lock.json` is written behind Airtable's Socket Firewall registry and is committed exactly
as npm produces it; never rewrite it. CI installs through `.github/actions/npm-ci`, which points the
runner's copy of the lockfile at the public registry, installs through Socket Firewall Free (`sfw
npm ci`) so CI installs are scanned, and restores the file; the integrity hashes are verified either
way.

Prettier leaves alone what must keep its bytes (`.prettierignore`): `legacy/**`, `web/index.html`
(dist parity compares against it verbatim), the gin and fidice `index.html` and `theme.css` (the
legacy layout, so a diff against `legacy/` reads as the hoist alone; backgammon's, with no legacy
twin, are formatted), the generated fixtures, `docs/` and `infra/turn-worker/`.

## Tests

The pyramid, bottom up (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "Testing pyramid" has the full lists):

1. **Unit** (`npm test`): vitest on the colocated `*.test.ts`: engine and domain table tests,
   property tests through `legalActions`, protocol decoders against malformed and hostile frames,
   the pure UI and scorer helpers, the shared edges with fakes. Everything is seeded
   (`web/shared/lib/rng.ts`, mulberry32), so the coverage figures are deterministic and
   `vitest.config.ts` pins a threshold per folder.
2. **Parity oracles** (in `npm test`): `test/parity/*.legacy.test.ts` run each assertion with
   `describe.each` on the frozen legacy code and on the port. The legacy side is cut verbatim out of
   the never-edited pages under `legacy/` into `test/fixtures/legacy/*.cjs` by
   `tools/legacy/extract-*.ts` and pinned by sha256 in `MANIFEST.json`; `manifest.test.ts` re-runs
   the extractors on every run and `frozen.test.ts` pins the whole files. 400 seeded gin games (1000 nightly) and
   12 seeded fidice bot games (`SEEDS` in `test/parity/fidice.legacy.test.ts`) replay through both
   legs with states deep-equal; recorded wire frames and localStorage captures decode and re-encode
   byte for byte. Known legacy defects the port fixes are named and pinned on the legacy leg only.
   Test hooks on the pages: `window.__gin`, `window.__fidice`, `window.__backgammon`,
   `window.__briscola`, and `window.__rng` as the rng when installed before boot. The backgammon
   engine has no legacy twin: its oracle is the seeded replay beside it
   (`web/games/backgammon/src/engine/replay.test.ts`, 91 matches per push and
   `BG_REPLAY_GAMES=1000` nightly) asserting every invariant on every step, with the enumeration
   of maximal plays as the oracle of the legal-move list; briscola's is the same shape
   (`web/games/briscola/src/engine/replay.test.ts`, `BRISCOLA_REPLAY_GAMES=1000` nightly), its wire
   goldens under `test/fixtures/briscola-wire/` self-recorded like backgammon's.
3. **Dist guards** (`npm run test:site`, which builds first; `test/dist/`, the `site` suite): every URL in dist HTML and
   CSS is relative and resolves on both origins through the Worker's real `mapPath()`; every game
   page is a Vite module page that preloads the shared chunks (one common to all; the DOM edge is
   a second one gin and backgammon share) and links the shared stylesheet, then (a shell page)
   `web/shared/styles/shell.css`, then its theme (docs/design/dry-round-2.md G1, G4);
   `dist/index.html` is byte-identical to `web/index.html`; the backgammon board's two
   `grid-template-areas` strings agree with their pure twin (`backgammon-grid.test.ts`). The **class contract**
   (`class-contract.test.ts`): every class the game's TypeScript names has a rule in a stylesheet
   the page links and vice versa, with what the extraction cannot see tabled in
   `web/shared/styles/CONTRACT.md` (each row is checked against the tree, so it cannot go stale).
4. **Computed-style goldens** (`e2e/computed-styles.spec.ts`, `pages` project):
   `tools/parity/computed-styles.ts` drives each page through its screens at 390x844 and 1280x800
   and reads `getComputedStyle` for 60-110 selectors; `test/fixtures/styles/<game>.<viewport>.json`
   are the goldens. A CSS move that changes a computed value fails with one line per
   screen/selector/property.
5. **Transport integration** (`npm run test:shared-integration`, the `shared-integration` suite; never part of `npm test`): the real PeerJS adapter through a local
   PeerServer in Chromium runs the same contract scenario as `transport.fake.ts` and must produce
   the same log.
6. **Hermetic two-peer e2e** (`npm run test:e2e`; first time `npx playwright install chromium`):
   builds `dist/`, starts `tools/serve-dist.ts` (:4173), `tools/proxy-dev.ts` (:8787, the real
   Worker over :4173), a PeerServer (:9000) and, when `turnserver` is on PATH, a coturn TURN relay
   (:3478, static credentials, loopback only), then runs every spec in `e2e/` on projects `pages`
   and `proxy`: smoke on every page (zero uncaught exceptions, zero failed requests outside an
   allowlist), gin local and scorer, backgammon pass-and-play and its board geometry, briscola
   pass-and-play for two, three and four and its table geometry, the shared shell once for the
   three shell games (`e2e/shell-*.spec.ts`: the home screen, the pass-and-play start, the room,
   host reload and guest rejoin, the handoff; `docs/design/shared-shell.md` D1), and the `@online`
   specs (gin's deal and turns, fidice lobby/start, backgammon roll/move, briscola's deal) in a host and a guest context that meet through `?peer=` and
   take a STUN-only ICE list through `?ice=`; fonts and CDNs are answered from local copies and
   `Math.random` is seeded. The `@relay` spec (`e2e/shell-relay.spec.ts`, one describe per game,
   fidice included)
   opens both pages with `?ice-policy=relay` and an ICE list naming that relay (written per run under
   `e2e/fixtures/.generated/`, since its port follows the offset), so every candidate must cross it:
   every game still joins and plays, "Connected via relay" shows, and the selected candidate pair read
   off each `RTCPeerConnection` is a relay one. Without coturn they skip with the install line
   (`brew install coturn` / `apt-get install coturn`); `E2E_TURN=off` leaves the relay out on
   purpose. `e2e/gin-dom-parity.spec.ts` plays the same game on the served gin page
   and on the frozen legacy page (aliased in by the harness) and compares 84 checkpoints. The report
   lands in `playwright-report/` (`npx playwright show-report`). The two contexts connect over the
   machine's own addresses: a Cloudflare WARP-style tunnel that drops loopback UDP times them out.
   Every harness port is a base plus `E2E_PORT_OFFSET` (default 0; `e2e/fixtures/site.ts` `PORTS`):
   pages 4173+o, proxy 8787+o, PeerServer 9000+o, TURN 3478+o. To run a second e2e beside one
   that holds the defaults (another worktree, a lingering `npm run serve`), set the offset once and
   the servers, readiness URLs and `?peer=`/`?ice=` hooks all follow:
   `E2E_PORT_OFFSET=1000 npm run test:e2e -- e2e/smoke.spec.ts` binds 5173/9787/10000.
7. **Stories** (`e2e/gin-stories.spec.ts`, `pages` project; `docs/design/gin-draw-ghost-slot.md`
   §7-§8): sixteen catalogued table states of the gin page
   (`web/games/gin-rummy/src/stories/catalogue.ts`, one seeded deal played through the engine),
   each opened through the page's `?story=<id>` hook at 390x844, 1280x800 and 375x667 and checked
   against facts derived from the engine (what is tappable, fresh, locked, selected, enabled), the
   fixed geometry (no scroll, eleven same-size cells, two rows on a phone) and the owner's rule that
   a draw moves no card; at the first two viewports a screenshot is compared against the committed
   per-platform baseline in `e2e/__screenshots__/` (`maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.002`; a missing baseline
   fails). `?story=` alone lists the stories in the browser. After a named visual change re-record
   both platforms and say so in the PR:

   ```sh
   npm run test:e2e -- e2e/gin-stories.spec.ts --project pages --update-snapshots   # the -darwin.png files, locally
   gh workflow run stories-baselines.yml --ref <branch> && gh run download -n stories-baselines-linux -D e2e/__screenshots__   # the -linux.png files
   ```

8. **Advisory broker** (CI job `broker`, `continue-on-error`):
   `E2E_BROKER=cloud npm run test:e2e -- --grep "@online|@relay"` plays the same specs through
   0.peerjs.com (the TURN relay stays the local coturn), so a signalling regression is visible at
   review without a third party blocking a merge.
9. **Nightly** (`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`, 09:23 UTC or `gh workflow run nightly.yml`):
   `npm run test:deployed` (`E2E_TARGET=deployed`) runs the same `@online` and `@relay` specs with
   the deployed page, https://arisweedler-at.github.io/hyperagent-web-apps/, as the subject: the
   `pages` project's baseURL is that origin, and the page is opened with the same `?peer=` and
   `?ice=` hooks, naming the PeerServer, ICE lists and coturn the harness started on the runner
   (the build only feeds the serve-dist that hosts the lists). A public https page reaching
   127.0.0.1 needs Chromium's Local Network Access permission, which the player fixture grants to
   its context. There is no `proxy` project in that run and nothing fetches `turn.sweedler.com`:
   games.sweedler.com and the credential Worker are Cloudflare, whose bot protection challenged the
   runner once (issue #19), and no test depends on Cloudflare. What it proves is that the bytes
   Pages serves still play a two-peer game and a relay-forced one; the deployed relay credentials
   are checked by hand (see "Online play", "Verify"). A failure comments the run URL on the open
   issue labelled `nightly` (creating it when missing); a green run closes it.

**Moving a golden.** A PR that changes what a golden pins says so in its body and touches only that
golden. Computed styles: `npm run build`, then
`node --experimental-strip-types tools/parity/computed-styles.ts` rewrites the six files
(`--check` compares without writing; a `--token` the golden never recorded is a note, not a failure,
until re-recorded). Legacy cuts: `npm run fixtures:legacy`, and the PR says why the oracle moved
(`legacy/**` itself is never edited). Gin wire frames and storage captures:
`npm run fixtures:gin-wire`, `npm run fixtures:gin-storage`. The class contract: edit the row in
`CONTRACT.md`.

## Add a game

A game is a folder; under `web/shared` only the `Game` row in `web/shared/lib/roomCode.ts`
changes, and the proxy needs nothing (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "Conventions for small diffs" and
"Module boundaries").

1. `web/games/<g>/index.html`: the markup, `<link rel="stylesheet">` to
   `../../shared/styles/tokens.css`, `../../shared/styles/base.css` and `./theme.css` in that order,
   and `<script type="module" src="./main.ts">`. Vite's input glob (`web/**/index.html`) picks the
   folder up and builds `dist/games/<g>/index.html` with `app-[hash].js` beside it; the shared chunk
   and every CSS file land under `dist/shared/assets/`. Never a `/`-rooted URL: guard 1 fails.
   A game on the shared shell does not write the shell's markup (`docs/design/dry-round-2.md` G2):
   `web/games/<g>/page.ts` declares its `ShellPage` (`web/shared/markup/shell.ts`: the copy the
   pages spell differently, the comment notes, how the page spells each shell look, and its own
   blocks, verbatim: the head, the table, the endgame, its sheets, its options with `#hostBtn` and
   the two name inputs), `tools/shell-markup.ts` lists it in `PAGES`, and
   `node --experimental-strip-types tools/shell-markup.ts --write` composes `index.html` from
   `web/shared/markup/shell/*.html`, formatted with Prettier when `.prettierignore` leaves the page
   to it. The composed page is committed, and `test/dist/shell-markup.test.ts` pins it to the render
   (and the partials' ids plus `BLOCK_IDS`/`SCREEN_IDS` to `SHELL_IDS`), so the tool is re-run after
   every edit to a partial or a `page.ts`; a shell id the page renames fails there and in
   `shell-ids.test.ts` before a painter fails at boot.
2. `web/games/<g>/theme.css`: the game's rules over the thirteen tokens `tokens.css` declares (to use
   another palette, override them on `:root` as fidice does; `CONTRACT.md` "Tokens").
3. `web/games/<g>/main.ts`: the boot and no logic. Construct the adapters (`realTransport`,
   `createIce(browserIceDeps())`, `browserStore`, `realClock`, `Math.random` or `window.__rng`) and
   inject them; expose `window.__<g>` as the page's test hook.
4. `web/games/<g>/src/`: the layers `eslint.config.js` and `tsconfig.pure.json` recognise by path.
   `engine/` or `domain/` and `bots/` are pure (no DOM lib, no loops, no `let`, no throw, no
   classes; a reducer such as gin's `applyAction(state, seat, action, rng)` returns a new state
   as a `Result` and never mutates; a two-seat engine takes `Seat`, `Pair`, `Player`, `Now` and
   `RuleError` from `web/shared/lib/game.ts` and publishes `ENGINE: TwoSeatEngine<…>` from its
   `engine/index.ts`, the one surface the shared shell types against). `protocol.ts` (at `src/`
   or `src/net/`) is pure and the trust
   boundary: every inbound frame through a `Result` decoder. `net/{host,guest}.ts` are edges that
   take a `Transport` and never import `peerjs`. `ui/` or `view/` render to strings or VNodes with
   DOM writes in one module. `storage.ts` (or `app/effects.ts`, fidice's shape; both are the eslint
   storage zone) is the only localStorage reader, through `web/shared/edge/storage.ts` with a
   decoder on every read. Imports are relative with an explicit `.ts`
   (`../../../../shared/edge/storage.ts`); no `@shared` alias is wired. A loop goes into
   `*.algorithms.ts` with a reason comment and 100% line coverage.
   `Math.random` is banned outside `main.ts` and `web/shared/edge`; the pure layers (`engine/`,
   `domain/`, `bots/`, `protocol.ts`, the scorer maths, `*.algorithms.ts`) also ban `Date.now`:
   inject a clock.
5. Tests beside each module, and a suite row for the game in `tools/ci/suites.ts`: its `unit`
   globs (`web/games/<g>/**/*.test.ts` and any `test/parity/<g>.*` oracles), its `coverage.include`
   folders with one threshold row per group (measured minus a margin; nothing existing goes down),
   its e2e half `gameE2e('<g>')` and a `gameRules('<g>')` entry, both read off the game's `REGISTRY`
   row (step 7: `suite` names the `test/parity/<g>.*` prefix and the folder, `specs` its own e2e
   globs, `shell` adds the shell specs with the tag), so a change under `web/games/<g>/**` runs `<g>`,
   `e2e-<g>`, `site`, `e2e-site` and `harness`. `tools/ci/suites.test.ts`
   fails until every new test file is claimed by exactly one suite, and its lists of the suites, the
   jobs and the tags (with `tools/ci/affected.test.ts`'s matrices and `tools/games.test.ts`'s
   `GAMES`) each gain the name; `npm run test:<g>` (two `package.json` scripts, `test:<g>` and
   `test:e2e:<g>`, spelled as the others') is then the game's own loop and CI's two matrix jobs
   (`game`, `e2e-game`) pick `<g>` up from `GAME_SUITES` through `tools/ci/affected.ts`:
   `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is not edited (the same test pins that no game is spelled there).
6. A class TypeScript builds in a way the extraction cannot see, a hook with no rule, or dead CSS
   gets a row in `web/shared/styles/CONTRACT.md`; otherwise `class-contract.test.ts` fails after the
   build.
7. Join the registry the harness enumerates: add the game to the `Game` union in
   `web/shared/lib/roomCode.ts` (with its room-code row), then a row to `REGISTRY` in
   `tools/games.ts` (title, hook, its suite name and own spec globs for step 5, storage keys, PeerJS
   debug level, page shape, class-contract floors; `LEGACY_GAMES` only if it has a frozen
   `legacy/<g>/index.html`); `GAMES`, `PAGE_TITLES` and `HOOKS` are read off the rows, and the e2e
   fixtures, the dist guards and
   `tools/parity/computed-styles.ts` enumerate from them (then record the game's two goldens). Add a
   card to `web/index.html`.
8. One e2e spec per mode: `e2e/<g>-local.spec.ts` and `e2e/<g>-online.spec.ts` tagged `@online`,
   both on the fixtures of `e2e/fixtures/two-players.ts`: `player` is one browser context and
   `players` two (host and guest), each seeded, recording its `new Peer` calls and aimed at the
   local PeerServer, and every context a spec opened is checked for uncaught exceptions at teardown.
   That fixture keeps one `DRIVERS` row per game (host a room, read its code, join by code; a game
   the registry knows without one is a type error), a shell game's being `shellDriver('<g>')`. The
   online spec opens with `connect(players, project, '<g>')` from `e2e/fixtures/online-games.ts`,
   which hosts, joins and asserts the connection through the game's row there, and then asks only
   the game's half (a legal play propagating, both tables agreeing), as `gin-online.spec.ts` and
   `backgammon-online.spec.ts` do; the shell's half (the room, the join, the start on both tables,
   the names, `expectPeerOptions` on the recorded `new Peer` call) is `e2e/shell-online.spec.ts`,
   once for every game. Both run on both projects (`npm run test:e2e:<g>` runs the game's specs
   alone), and the online one against the deployed page in nightly, for free; a spec about the page
   alone (geometry, stories, pass-and-play) is listed in `PAGE_ONLY_SPECS` in `e2e/fixtures/site.ts`
   and plays on `pages` only. A game built on the shared shell (the home screen, the waiting rooms,
   the curtain: `docs/design/shared-shell.md` §3.1) joins `SHELL_GAMES` and `SHELL` in
   `tools/games.ts` and gets a `ShellDriver` row in `e2e/fixtures/online-games.ts` (its `glossary`
   terms included): `e2e/shell-*.spec.ts` then drive its shell (home, local, online, relay, resume,
   handoff, liveness, glossary), and `gameE2e` lists them on its suite row with the tag, off the
   `shell` row. A game with its own lobby (fidice today) gets an `OnlineDriver` row there instead of
   an online spec of its own: `e2e/shell-online.spec.ts` and `shell-relay.spec.ts` loop over every
   game, and `gameE2e` lists those two on a row without `shell`; the game's own specs are its row's
   `specs`. The shared host session seats up to four guests (`docs/design/n-seat-sessions.md`); the
   two-seat games keep every byte, and `players` is still host and guest.
9. The proxy needs nothing: the Worker's catch-all maps `games.sweedler.com/<g>/` to
   `/hyperagent-web-apps/games/<g>/`.

The existing files a game edits, verified by `grep -rl backgammon` over the tree at `9bf1548`
(every other file naming a game is a comment, that game's own folder or a test of it):
`web/shared/lib/roomCode.ts` (the `Game` union, the room-code row, the code normaliser),
`tools/games.ts` (`GameSuite`, the `REGISTRY` row; `ShellGame`, `SHELL_GAMES` and `SHELL` for a
shell game), `tools/ci/suites.ts` (the suite row), `eslint.config.js` (`GAMES`),
`tsconfig.node.json` (the `src/**` include), `web/index.html` (the card),
`tools/parity/computed-styles.ts` (its selectors and driver, then its two goldens under
`test/fixtures/styles/`), `e2e/fixtures/online-games.ts` (the driver row),
`e2e/fixtures/two-players.ts` (the `DRIVERS` row), `package.json` (`test:<g>`, `test:e2e:<g>`),
`web/shared/styles/CONTRACT.md` (its rows) and, for a shell game, `tools/shell-markup.ts`
(`PAGES`) and `web/shared/ui/ids.ts` (its own `SHELL_GAMES`, the list `tools/games.ts` exports
spelled a second time; `test/dist/shell-ids.test.ts` iterates it, so a shell page left out of it is
never checked for the shell ids); plus the six lists that pin the games by name:
`tools/games.test.ts`, `tools/ci/suites.test.ts`, `tools/ci/affected.test.ts`,
`web/shared/lib/roomCode.test.ts`, `web/shared/ui/ids.test.ts`, `test/dist/classes.test.ts`
(`OWNERS`, read off `GAMES`). Only
when the game has one: `e2e/fixtures/site.ts` (`PAGE_ONLY_SPECS`, a page-only spec),
`.github/workflows/nightly.yml` (a seeded replay step), `test/tokens.test.ts` (a theme's `:root`
pin). Not edited: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `playwright.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `infra/`
(the alias table aside). `docs/design/dry-round-2.md` §1 item 8 counted eight files plus
`CONTRACT.md`: it left out `two-players.ts`'s `DRIVERS` row, `package.json`'s two scripts,
`ui/ids.ts`'s `SHELL_GAMES` and the pins, and its I7 (`PAGE_ONLY_SPECS` self-declared per spec) was
optional and did not land.

A second URL name for a game (`sheshbesh` for backgammon) is an alias, not a game: one row in
`ALIASES` in `tools/games.ts` and the same row in `infra/games-proxy/worker.ts` (its test pins the
two equal), plus the stub `web/games/<alias>/index.html` copied from `web/games/sheshbesh/`. No
landing card, no `GAMES`, room-code, title or hook row (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "Two origins",
Aliases). The Worker must be redeployed for the alias to answer on games.sweedler.com.

## Deploy

**GitHub Pages.** The `deploy` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on a push to `main` once
`check` (which built, guarded and uploaded `dist/`) and `e2e` pass: it downloads that artifact and
runs `actions/configure-pages`, `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and `actions/deploy-pages`, then
prints both served URLs in its summary. Nothing generated is committed. One-time console setting:
**Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source: GitHub Actions**. Roll a bad deploy back by
reverting the commit on `main`; the same job redeploys the previous `dist/`.

Cache window: a game page is an unhashed `index.html` referencing hashed sub-resources, and both
origins send `cache-control: max-age=600` on it. A deploy that changes a hash (a revert included)
can leave a browser holding the cached page 404ing on the previous `app-[hash].js` or shared chunk,
an empty page, for up to 10 minutes until it reloads.

**games.sweedler.com.** `infra/games-proxy/worker.ts` (TypeScript; wrangler bundles it as is) with
its `wrangler.toml` (custom domain route). Deploy by hand, wrangler is not a dependency of this
repo:

```
cd infra/games-proxy
npx wrangler deploy
```

The path mapping is the table at the top of `worker.ts`; `worker.test.ts` pins every row and
`tools/proxy-dev.ts` runs the same handler locally.

**turn.sweedler.com.** `infra/turn-worker/worker.js`, plain JavaScript deployed by hand: see
"Online play".

**Nightly.** `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` plays the deployed Pages page every night through the
harness's own local servers (see "Tests" 9; nothing Cloudflare is in the loop, so
games.sweedler.com is not played by any test); `gh workflow run nightly.yml` runs it after a deploy
you want checked now.

## Online play (TURN relay)

**Why.** Online play is peer-to-peer over WebRTC; PeerJS only brokers the handshake. When both
devices sit behind NAT a direct path cannot be punched and a TURN relay is mandatory. The free
anonymous relays the games used to rely on are gone (PeerJS's `*.turn.peerjs.com` hosts no longer
resolve; `openrelay.metered.ca` rejects the old shared credentials). With no relay configured the
games fall back to STUN-only and the host's wait screen shows a warning.

**Where to configure.** One constant, `ICE_CONFIG_URL` in `web/shared/edge/ice.ts` (bundled into
both games), points at `https://turn.sweedler.com`, the Worker below. For a test, `?ice=<url>` on a
game URL overrides it without editing the file, and `?ice-policy=relay` forces
`iceTransportPolicy: 'relay'` so only relayed candidates are used (the `@relay` specs' relay-forced
games). The URL must return JSON, a bare array of ICE servers or `{"iceServers":[...]}`, with CORS
headers that allow both site origins. Results are cached for 10 minutes; a fetch failure falls back
to STUN-only.

**The Worker (Cloudflare Realtime TURN).** 1000 GB/month free, and the key stays secret because
`infra/turn-worker/` mints short-lived credentials on demand.

1. dash.cloudflare.com -> Realtime -> TURN -> Create key. Copy the Key ID and the API token (the
   token is shown once).
2. Put the Key ID in `TURN_KEY_ID` under `[vars]` in `infra/turn-worker/wrangler.toml` (it is not
   secret), then:
   ```
   cd infra/turn-worker
   npx wrangler login
   npx wrangler deploy
   npx wrangler secret put TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN
   ```
   Deploy before the secret put so the Worker exists.
3. `wrangler.toml` routes the Worker at `turn.sweedler.com` (custom domain on the sweedler.com
   zone); it also answers on the account's `*.workers.dev` URL. `ICE_CONFIG_URL` names the former.

The other vars: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated browser origins allowed to fetch credentials;
both site origins are listed; empty allows any; requests with no Origin header, such as curl,
always pass) and `TTL_SECONDS` (credential lifetime, default 7200; a game session should fit inside
it). To test with `?ice=` from a local dev server, add its origin (for example
`http://localhost:8765`) or leave the list empty.

**Alternative: Metered.ca** (no server). Create a free account and app at https://www.metered.ca/
and set `ICE_CONFIG_URL` to `https://<app>.metered.live/api/v1/turn/credentials?apiKey=<key>`. The
key is visible in page source, acceptable for a free-tier hobby quota (0.5 GB/month at the time of
writing) that is ample for text-only game traffic.

**Verify.**

- `curl https://turn.sweedler.com` prints JSON containing `turn:` and/or `turns:` entries.
- Open a game (with `?ice=<url>` to test another endpoint) and host a room. The wait screen shows
  a relay hint only when no relay is configured.
- Connect a second device. A toast says "Connected via relay" or "Connected directly".
- No test fetches `turn.sweedler.com` (the harness relays through its own coturn), so the deployed
  credentials are checked here, by hand: `curl` above, then a game with `?ice-policy=relay` and no
  `?ice=` that toasts "Connected via relay".

vitest.config.ts             one project per suite of tools/ci/suites.ts; the coverage block computed from VITEST_SUITE
playwright.config.ts         projects pages and proxy; E2E_BROKER=cloud, E2E_TARGET=deployed, E2E_PORT_OFFSET, E2E_TURN

```

There is no `stories/` and no Storybook: the UI is pinned by the class contract, the computed-style
goldens and the e2e specs (see "Tests").
