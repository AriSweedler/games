// the PeerJS debug level, its test suite and its own specs) is written once; GAMES, PAGE_TITLES and
// HOOKS are read off the rows, and tools/ci/suites.ts derives each game suite's rows from them.
// `Game` itself is web/shared/lib/roomCode.ts's closed union, so a game the harness names must
// have a room-code row, and a game the union gains shows up here as a type error until it has a
// row. tools/games.test.ts pins every value. The `shell` block of §6.1 (the heading, the tabs, the

// game, spread into the game's REGISTRY row; e2e/shell-*.spec.ts drive every shell game by it.
