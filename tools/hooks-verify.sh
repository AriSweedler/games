#      script, so `npm ci` installs it);
#   2. both shims are executable and parse (`sh -n`);
#   3. the owner's template hook .git/hooks/pre-commit exists, so the pre-commit shim has
#      something to chain to. CI checkouts have no template hook, so under CI=… that is reported
#      rather than failed.
# Exits non-zero on the first failure.
