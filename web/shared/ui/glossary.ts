// Glossary links (docs/design/glossary-links.md): jargon in a game's About copy, and in a rule that
// names another rule, is a link to that rule. The owner: "Clicking jargon in the 'about' section
// will take you to the 'rules' section. This should be true for ALL of the games." Pure and
// shared: a game supplies its rules as `RuleItem`s with ids and its `Glossary` (the words that mean
// each rule); these helpers build the rules list with the anchors, wrap the terms in links and read
// a `#rule-<id>` deep link. The edge that scrolls and flashes the rule is web/shared/edge/glossary.ts.
