# web/shared/ui

The shared shell's UI code (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Seams reserved for the roadmap"). Reserved
since step 5 so the module boundaries and the class contract had a home to name; the first module
landed with the glossary links (docs/design/glossary-links.md):

| Module          | Holds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `glossary.ts`   | `RuleItem`, `Glossary`; `ruleAnchor(id)` (`rule-<id>`), `linkJargon(html, glossary, { except })` (the first whole-word term per rule wrapped as `<a class="jargon" data-rule>`, longest terms first, never inside a tag or a link), `rulesListHtml(items, glossary)`, `ruleFromHash(hash)`                                                                                                                                            |
| `shellPaint.ts` | The shell painters and binders both games carried under one name (docs/design/shared-shell.md §4.4, moved in B1), each over the view it reads rather than an App: `paintScreen(doc, screens, current, fixedOn)`, `paintWaiting(doc, WaitingView)`, `showToast(doc, msg, marks?)`/`hideToast`, `paintSound`, `paintHandoff(doc, label or null)`, `paintSheet`, `bindSheets(doc, sheets, dispatch, { escapeFallback }?)`, `ensureKeyed` |
| `curtain.ts`    | `CurtainText` (+ optional `attrs` on the button: backgammon's `data-rolls`), `paintCurtain(doc, text or null)` (null hides, texts untouched), `bindCurtain(doc, dispatch, onReveal)`; each game keeps its `curtainText`                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `toast.ts`      | `TOAST_MS`, `createTimers<Id>(clock)` (the named-timer Map both `main.ts` files kept: arming restarts, a fired timer forgets itself) and `createToaster(doc, clock, defaultMs?, marks?)` (gin's single restarting hide timer); an edge in eslint.config.js `EDGES` because the timers are state                                                                                                                                       |
| `ids.ts`        | `SHELL_GAMES` and `SHELL_IDS`, the ids every shell page carries; `test/dist/shell-ids.test.ts` asserts them on the built pages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `home.ts`       | The home shell both games' `ui/home.ts` compose (docs/design/shared-shell.md §4.4, moved in §5 B2): `HomeView`, `fillInputs`, `setCodeInput`, `tabButtonId`, `blocksCodeInput`, `paintTabs`, `paintPlayMode`, `paintSubmenu`, `paintResume`, `paintHomeShell(doc, view, { tabs, modes })`, `bindHomeShell(doc, dispatch, { tabs, startOptions, intents })` over the game's `ShellIntentBuilders`, `bindLongPress`                     |

The helpers (`glossary.ts`, `ids.ts`) are lint-pure like `web/shared/lib` (eslint.config.js
`PURE`, tsconfig.pure.json); the painters and binders write the document and are carved out of the
pure profile the way `scorer/main.ts` is (`web/shared/ui/!(shellPaint|curtain|toast|home).ts`, the
same four excluded from tsconfig.pure.json and tsconfig.node.json, so tsconfig.web.json alone
compiles them). The whole folder is held at 100% coverage (tools/ci/suites.ts, the `shared`
suite: every module has its test beside it, the painters' over `web/shared/edge/page.fake.ts`);
the edge that scrolls and flashes a rule is `web/shared/edge/glossary.ts`. Its import zone is a
game's `ui/` zone: `web/shared/lib` and the DOM edge (`dom.ts` and its fakes), plus the clock fake
for `toast.ts`'s test. Gin's shell (home tabs, mode switch, waiting rooms, curtain,
result sheets) was copied into `web/games/backgammon/src/ui/` with the same field, intent and
painter names on purpose (docs/design/backgammon-board.md §4), which is what makes each move here
mechanical: a game's `ui/render.ts`, `ui/local.ts` and `main.ts` compose the shared module under
the old names, so their tests run unchanged. The two-seat host/guest sessions landed first as
`web/shared/net/` (shared-shell.md A1).

What lands here later, and where it comes from (docs/design/shared-shell.md §5):

| Module        | Contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Source                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `boot.ts`     | Landed as `web/shared/edge/boot.ts` instead (B3: `applyInviteLink`, `shareInvite` with the invite copy, `sessionEvents`; it reaches `edge/invite.ts`, `edge/share.ts`, `edge/fx.ts` and `web/shared/net`, outside this folder's zone), where `bootShell(cfg)` (C3) joins them | both `main.ts`                      |
| `shell.ts`    | `reduceShell`, `runShellEffect`, `hostContextOf`, `guestContextOf`, `saveFor`, `readHome` over a game's `shellConfig.ts`                                                                                                                                                      | both `ui/state.ts` (C2)             |
| `HandView.ts` | `HandView { render(model, selection): string }`, the only way a hand is drawn                                                                                                                                                                                                 | gin `ui/hand/HandView.ts` (step 11) |

The generic CSS primitives this table once reserved as `base.css` landed in
`web/shared/styles/base.css` instead (docs/MIGRATION.md step 14: the box-sizing reset,
`html, body { margin: 0 }` and `.hidden`, the only rules both themes carried identically), beside
`tokens.css` and `CONTRACT.md`; stylesheets live with the tokens, builders live here.

Rules that will apply: builders return `SafeHtml` or write through `@shared/edge/dom` only; no
`peerjs`, no `localStorage`, no timers except through an injected `Clock`; every class they toggle
is a row in `web/shared/styles/CONTRACT.md`. The backgammon page already follows them: its board
builders (`ui/board.ts`) return strings tested as strings, its painters write through
`web/shared/edge/dom.ts`, and its template-built class names are `backgammon` rows in the contract.
