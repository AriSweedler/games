// The shell reducer both games ran as two copies (docs/design/shared-shell.md §4.2, moved here in
// §5 C2): the home screen, the waiting rooms, the session (who plays, from which device), the
// resume offer, the Play tab's submenu and the leave flow, over intents, returning the next App
// with a list of effects as data. Gin's cases as they stood after C1 (`App = { shell, table }`),
// with everything the two copies disagreed on injected through a `ShellConfig` (§4.3): the game's
// id, names, tabs, copy, option codec, engine, frame builders, storage and the table hooks
// (`reset`, `rendered`, `refuse`, the pass-and-play `viewer`/`revealer`). The record is generic
// over one bag of the game's types (`ShellTypes`) rather than a dozen parameters, so a signature
// reads `ShellState<G>`; every literal this file writes into a generic field (`'play'`,
// `'online'`, `'homeScreen'`, `'longPress'`, `'tap'`) belongs to the shared half of that field's
// union, and the game's own half (`G['Tab']`, `G['Mode']`, …) is added by the config. Nothing
// here names a game (eslint.config.js: shared code never imports one), touches the store (the
// `Store` type is the game's, through `G['Store']`, because this zone reaches only web/shared/lib
// and the DOM edge) or spells a session's status copy (`cfg.copy.opening`, `connecting`,
// `handoff` come from web/shared/net through the game's config for the same reason). The effect
// runner is web/shared/ui/shellEffects.ts, beside this file, because it calls the adapters
// (statements the pure profile refuses). A game's `ui/state.ts` keeps its table slice and hooks,
// spells `reduce = isShellIntent ? reduceShell : tableIntent`, and re-exports what its tests
// import, so both games' state.test.ts run unchanged but for the `opts` rename C1 agreed.
//
// Two legacy traits kept on purpose (the gin reducer's header): the shell runs `rendered`'s state
// effects wherever the legacy called `render()`, and a leave closes the network before the state
// is reset, so the session's own close still raises the "disconnected" toast the legacy raised.
