// The host's side of a room, shared by every game that plays gin's pipe (docs/design/shared-shell.md
// §4.5, the plan's A1): gin's net/host.ts moved here as it was (`startHost` and the `peer`/`conn`
// handlers of the legacy multiplayer UI, frame for frame and timer for timer, over the shared
// Transport), with the two things a game owns injected. The frames come through a `HostCodec` (the
// game's guest-frame decoder, its `welcome` built from what the session reads off the app, its
// `full`), and the peer id through `HostOptions.game` (`peerIdFor`: 'sheshbesh-' is not derivable
// from 'backgammon', so the game is passed, never inferred). `HostContext<X>` carries the game's
// room payload (gin's `target`, backgammon's `matchLength` and `variant`) as `X`, read only by the
// codec's `welcome`. A game's net/host.ts is a wrapper that fixes `<G, H, X>` and re-exports every
// constant and message below, so its ui/state.ts, main.ts and tests import nothing from here.
//
// Seats (docs/design/n-seat-sessions.md §4; briscola's 3 and 4 players): the session hosts
// `capacity - 1` guest channels (`HostOptions.capacity`, default 2), each a seat numbered
// 1..capacity-1 (the host is seat 0 and has no channel) with its own heartbeat and silence watch.
// A peer that connects takes the lowest free seat; every event names the seat its channel holds
// (`frame(frame, seat)`, `guestGone(iceFailed, seat)`), `send(frame, seat?)` writes one open
// channel or every one, and `codec.welcome(ctx, seat)` tells a channel which seat it took. At
// capacity 2 there is one slot and every path below is the two-seat code it replaced, so
// sessions.test.ts, the two games' byte-pinning suites and the gin wire corpus run unchanged; the
// two-seat codecs take one parameter and set no `joinName`. What a seat means (names beyond the
// rejoin key, the lobby, redaction per seat, Start, teams, turn order) is the reducer's, not the
// session's: the session is a transport object over an injected codec and holds no game state.
//
// The session owns the Peer, the guest channels and the timers; everything it did to the page goes
// through `HostEvents` (status text, toasts, the wake lock, persisting) and everything it read off
// the `app` object comes back through `read()`, so sessions.test.ts and sessions.seats.test.ts
// drive it over transport.fake.ts and clock.fake.ts. Frames cross the trust boundary in the game's
// protocol.ts: an inbound frame the decoder refuses is dropped (the legacy ignored non-objects and
// unknown tags; a malformed `action` it would have handed to the engine, whose refusal it toasted
// back). A guest's frame is reported as the seat its channel holds and nothing on the wire says
// otherwise: a guest cannot act for another seat.
//
// Liveness (liveness.ts, the decision and its reasons in that header): the legacy learnt of a
// guest only from the channel's `close`, which PeerJS fires for a deliberate departure alone, so a
// guest whose tab died kept its seat for good. Both sessions now heartbeat below the codec: the
// host sends `{t: 'hb'}` every HB_MS on each open channel, counts every inbound frame as life, and
// after HB_GRACE_MS of silence closes the channel and raises `guestGone(null, seat)` once, exactly
// as a closed channel is reported, so the reducers' existing "they can rejoin with code X" copy
// and the freed seat follow with no game change. A join that arrives while every seat is taken
// and one guest has been silent for HB_MISSED_MS replaces the silent channel (the old one closed,
// no `guestGone`, the join re-seats) instead of being told the room is full. A join that arrives
// sooner is held (`accept`): the legacy's answer, `full` at once, was also the answer a guest got
// when it came back within seconds of its tab dying, and it got it every REJOIN_MS until the
// silence reached HB_MISSED_MS (five times in the liveness review). Held, the join is neither
// welcomed nor refused: its frames wait, one probe watches every seat, the first seat to reach
// HB_MISSED_MS of silence is the knocker's (welcomed with its waiting frames replayed, the other
// probes cancelled), and every seat beating within that time makes it a spare peer told `full`.
// A second join while one is held is a spare peer at once, and a held join takes the seat the
// moment any guest leaves on purpose. The transport's ICE states were not adopted (liveness.ts
// says why).
//
// Rejoin by name (n-seat-sessions.md §4.1, D6): with `codec.joinName` set, a decoded join whose
// name (trimmed, case-folded) matches the last name seated at another seat whose channel is gone
// or silent for HB_MISSED_MS is moved to that seat before it is reported (the silent channel
// closed with no `guestGone`; the seat it connected to is free again), so a guest whose tab died
// lands back in its own seat with the name its shell already saves, and a table of three or four
// keeps its turn order and partnerships. A seat merely quiet is presumed alive: a same-named
// newcomer sits where it connected and the reducer's `guestNameFor` dedupes the display name.
// Only the session can move a channel between seats, which is why this lives here and not in the
// reducer; tokens (a per-seat secret in the lobby) are the upgrade for two same-named players. A
// resumed room starts with every seat's key seeded from the host save (`HostOptions.names`): with
// the host back after a reload, its guests reconnect in whatever order their rejoin timers fire,
// and each is moved to the seat its name held before its join is reported, so nobody is renamed
// and no hand changes hands. The save holds the display names the reducer deduped, so a name it
// suffixed (" 2") is not matched by the raw name its guest sends again: that guest sits where it
// connected and is deduped once more, the two-same-names case the tokens are for.
//
// The netAttempt ticket: `whenTransportReady` waits on a network fetch, so its callback can land
// after the player has cancelled and started over, possibly with the same role and code. Each
// attempt takes a ticket (`HostOptions.attempt`, the app's `netAttempt` at the time); cancel and
// leave bump the app's, and a stale callback returns before creating a Peer.
