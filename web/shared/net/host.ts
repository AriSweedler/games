// The host's side of a two-seat room, shared by every game that plays gin's pipe
// (docs/design/shared-shell.md §4.5, the plan's A1): gin's net/host.ts moved here as it was
// (`startHost` and the `peer`/`conn` handlers of the legacy multiplayer UI, frame for frame and
// timer for timer, over the shared Transport), with the two things a game owns injected. The frames
// come through a `HostCodec` (the game's guest-frame decoder, its `welcome` built from what the
// session reads off the app, its `full`), and the peer id through `HostOptions.game`
// (`peerIdFor`: 'sheshbesh-' is not derivable from 'backgammon', so the game is passed, never
// inferred). `HostContext<X>` carries the game's room payload (gin's `target`, backgammon's
// `matchLength` and `variant`) as `X`, read only by the codec's `welcome`. A game's net/host.ts is
// a wrapper that fixes `<G, H, X>` and re-exports every constant and message below, so its
// ui/state.ts, main.ts and tests import nothing from here.
//
// The session owns the Peer, the one guest channel and the timers; everything it did to the page
// goes through `HostEvents` (status text, toasts, the wake lock, persisting) and everything it read
// off the `app` object comes back through `read()`, so sessions.test.ts drives it over
// transport.fake.ts and clock.fake.ts. Frames cross the trust boundary in the game's protocol.ts:
// an inbound frame the decoder refuses is dropped (the legacy ignored non-objects and unknown
// tags; a malformed `action` it would have handed to the engine, whose refusal it toasted back).
//
// The netAttempt ticket: `whenTransportReady` waits on a network fetch, so its callback can land
// after the player has cancelled and started over, possibly with the same role and code. Each
// attempt takes a ticket (`HostOptions.attempt`, the app's `netAttempt` at the time); cancel and
// leave bump the app's, and a stale callback returns before creating a Peer.
