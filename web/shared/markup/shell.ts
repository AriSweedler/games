// The shell's markup, spelled once (docs/design/dry-round-2.md §3 row G2, §5 Wave F row F2). A
// shell page (docs/design/shared-shell.md §3.1: the home screen, the waiting rooms, the curtain,
// the rules and history sheets, the toast) is the six partials under shell/ filled with the game's
// ShellPage (web/games/<g>/page.ts: its copy, its comment notes, how it spells each shell look, and
// its own markup) and composed by tools/shell-markup.ts into the committed web/games/<g>/index.html,
// which test/dist/shell-markup.test.ts pins to the render. Pure: strings in, a Result out, no file
// and no DOM, so the pure tsconfig compiles it and a game's page.ts imports only its types.
//
// A partial's `{{name}}` inline is a slot (a copy string, a comment note or a look). A line that is
// `{{name}}` alone, at column 0, is a block: the game's own markup replaces the line, carrying its
// own indentation and, where the page has one, the blank line above it; an empty block drops the
// line. A block is inserted verbatim (no placeholder inside it is filled), so a game's residue is
// the committed bytes cut out of its page. Every slot and block a page declares must be read by some
// partial and every placeholder filled: a hole no page fills or a value no partial reads is an error
// here, never a silent page.
