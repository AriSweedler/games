// line. A block is inserted verbatim (no placeholder inside it is filled), so a game's residue is
// the committed bytes cut out of its page. Every slot and block a page declares must be read by some
// partial and every placeholder filled: a hole no page fills or a value no partial reads is an error
// here, never a silent page.
