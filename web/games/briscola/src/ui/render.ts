// Where the briscola page's DOM writes for the game screens live (docs/design/briscola.md §5.2 "The
// DOM", §5.4 "Interaction", §5.6 "Testability"; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Module boundaries": ui/
// reaches the document only through the shared DOM edge). `paint(doc, app)` is idempotent and runs
// after every intent: the screen switch and the waiting statuses, the home screen (ui/home.ts), the
// card pack's tokens, the curtain (ui/local.ts), the table, the result sheet (where every game
// ends, with Play again; the shell's end screen is never shown) and the overlays, each written
// from the App (ui/state.ts) alone, so the same App always paints the same DOM. Backgammon's
// ui/render.ts is the shape; the table is this game's.
//
// The table is keyed (§5.2): every container carries `data-key` and is rebuilt from ui/table.ts's
// builders only when its key changes (web/shared/ui/keyed.ts `ensureKeyed`), so a lift never
// rebuilds the hand and a play changes exactly two keys; `selected`, `playable`, `taking`,
// `arriving`, `to-move`, `gone`, `empty`, `tappable`, `inert`, `active` and `hidden-cards` toggle
// outside the key on every paint. The settle beat (§5.4, ui/state.ts `settle`) is paint-driven:
// while a trick is held or in flight the seats, the score strip, my taken count and the strips of
// chips read as before the trick was scored (the chip the cards fly to is laid hidden for the
// flight), and the stock and the briscola as before the draw through every stage, so the counters
// visibly tick after the cards land; the flights themselves (ui/motion.ts) leave once
// per stage, which `#tableScreen[data-beat]` remembers. `bindAll` turns the table's and the
// overlays' controls into intents (one delegated click on `#hand`; Enter/Space on a focused slot is
// the same tap, §5.5); the input wiring of the home screen and the curtain is beside their paints.
// The phone's menu sheet is the one thing toggled here rather than painted from the App (see
// `bindMenu`). The cards' names come from the App's language pack (docs/design/language-packs.md
// §5): every face-up card's `aria-label`, the `.card-name` caption under each play and under the
// stock for the briscola, the `#cardTip` over a hovered or long-pressed hand card (`paintTip`, from
// `table.tip`; `bindTip` turns the hand's pointer events into its intents) and the card view's
// line (`paintCardView`, from `table.cardView`).
