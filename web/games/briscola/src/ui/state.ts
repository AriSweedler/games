// The briscola app as a reducer over intents (docs/design/briscola.md §5.4 "Interaction";
// docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Module boundaries": imported only by main.ts, the painters and tests).
// `App = { shell, table }`: `shell` is the home screen, the waiting rooms, the session (role, code,
// names, the engine `State` for the host and pass-and-play, my `View` for every role) and the
// resume offer, the record the shared shell reducer owns (web/shared/ui/shell.ts `reduceShell`,
// docs/design/shared-shell.md §4.2) over the config `BRISCOLA` below (shellConfig.ts's half
// completed here with the table hooks: `reset` per site, `rendered`, `refuse`, pass-and-play's
// `viewer`/`revealer`, and the home snapshot's own part); `table` is the table's interaction
// memory (the hand's kept slots, a lifted card, a drag, the settle beat, the sheets, the curtain,
// the card pack, the third and fourth names), which no other game has. `Intent` is every handler
// and every network event, and `reduce` returns the next App with a list of `Effect`s: what to
// persist, toast, send, play or arm, as data. main.ts runs the effects through the real adapters
// (`runEffect`: briscola's three, then the shared runner) and paints the App (ui/render.ts); the
// tests run the reducer alone. The first game booted through the shared shell (D18).
//
// Briscola's residue on the shell: pass-and-play seats two, three or four (D1, D17), so `reduce`
// takes `local/click` itself (the shell's case seats a pair) and creates the N-seat game before
// handing it to the shared `startLocal`, drops the handoff at three and four seats (offered at two
// only), and persists the room's options after a start; the guest whose match is over when the
// host drops (`hostLeft`, backgammon's) is taken before the shell's `guest/lost` too.
//
// Turn authority is gin's: the host applies `applyAction` for both seats and broadcasts
// `viewFor(game, 1)` as a `state` frame, a refusal to the guest is a `toast` frame; the guest sends
// `action` frames; pass-and-play keeps the `State` here with no Peer (D20: no undo, a played card
// is public the instant it is played).
//
// The settle beat (§5.4): a resolved trick is `settle 'hold'` (the trick painted from the record,
// the taker's card lifted), then `'fly'` (the cards to the winner), then `'draw'` (a back to each
// seat in `drew` order), each a `settle` timer; the view is painted cold when the beat ends. The
// beat is paint-driven, so it plays the same on every device from one `state` frame, and in
// pass-and-play the curtain waits for it (`viewer` keeps the phone holder's view while a trick
// settles). Sounds are event-driven (docs/design/briscola-sound-history.md §3.5, §5): `rendered`
// finds the events new since the view it replaces (`continuedEvents` says which stream that view
// continues) and hands them to the shared `eventEffects` (web/shared/ui/eventEffects.ts), which
// gathers their phrases (`phraseOf`, ui/sound.ts) into ONE `phrases` effect the shell plays back to
// back in the App's font, once per view (`cues.key`), so a re-sent frame plays nothing; the card
// laid and the turn chime stay `fx` rows of the table.
