// The table's pure builders (docs/design/briscola.md §5.2 "The DOM", §5.5, §5.6, §5.7): the markup
// strings the painter writes into the keyed containers of `#tableScreen`, the keys that say when a
// container must be rebuilt, and the small copy the containers carry (the lead cue, the stock
// label, the score cells). Everything is a function of a `View`'s parts, a few UI
// facts (the kept slots, the lifted card, the taking seat, the chip in flight) and the chosen card
// pack, tested as strings like backgammon's ui/board.ts. It imports the engine and the shared card packs only:
// the reducer imports this module, never the reverse, and the DOM is the painter's.
//
// Faces and backs come only through the shared packs (web/shared/ui/cardFace.ts, D11): a face is
// `faceHtml(resolveFace(pack, 'italian40', id))`, so any pack that draws `italian40` paints here
// unchanged; a card the pack has no picture for is the glyph, and a pack with no back takes the
// deck default's (`resolveBack`, the painter's `--back`). `faceHtml` owns the card's opening tag,
// so the hand's button semantics (`role`, `tabindex`, `aria-label`, `aria-pressed`, §5.5) sit on
// the `.slot` that holds the card, and a fan card's `data-seat` (§5.6 `#trick .card[data-seat]`)
// is written into that tag by `withDataSeat`, the one attribute a face never carries itself.
// Names are the shell's normalised ones but are escaped anyway: a name is a player's text. A
// card's name comes from the chosen language pack (web/shared/lib/lang/packs.ts, docs/design/
// language-packs.md): the face's `aria-label` wherever a `lang` is passed, and a `.card-name`
// caption under each play of the trick (the owner: the suits are unfamiliar, so the table says
// what was played) and under the stock for the briscola.
