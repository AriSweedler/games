// The copy of the event stream (docs/design/briscola-rules.md D23, E6, E8, E12-E14, E18, E23):
// English with the Italian card names, every name the shell's normalised one, a four-player side
// read "Ari and Jeff" in seat order. Nothing here is stored: `summaryOf(event, players, n)` is a
// history row's one line and `detailOf` its expanded label/value pairs, both derived from the
// same event the sounds read (design/briscola-sound-history §3.5, §5), so the copy can be read,
// and pinned, in one place. `playText` serves the status line over `lastPlayed` (E6). Kept apart
// from the reducer, which stores facts, not sentences.
