// The reducer (docs/design/briscola-rules.md D20, E6-E14, E21, E25): `applyAction(state, seat,
// action, rng, now)` returns a new State or a refusal worded for the player, never mutates, never
// throws, and is the single entry the local reducer and the online host share. A `play` moves one
// card from the hand to the trick; the n-th card resolves the trick, draws for every seat while
// the stock lasts and hands the lead to the winner, all in the same state; the last trick ends the
// game and tallies the match; `next` at `over` deals the following game. The rng is read by `next`
// alone (the shuffle); the clock stamps every event. What the engine records is the event stream
// (E18): one `trick` event per resolved trick carrying `trickFacts`' reading of it, one `exchange`,
// one `result`; a play mid-trick is on the table (`trick`) and nowhere else.
