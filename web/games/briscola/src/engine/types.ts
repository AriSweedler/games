// Shapes of the briscola engine (docs/design/briscola-rules.md §2; rules E1-E3, E12, E13, E24).
// One N-seat engine for 2, 3 and 4 players (D1): seats are 0..n-1, play runs to the next index,
// and with four the even seats are one side (D6). Key order here is the wire and save order:
// setup.ts and apply.ts build every literal in it and decode.ts declares the fields in it, so a
// decoded value re-encodes byte for byte (E20). The player, the clock and the refusal text are
// web/shared/lib/game.ts's (the two-seat contract, DRY round 2 F1), re-exported under the names the
// modules import; `Seat` is this engine's own, four wide, so `game.ts`'s `Seat`, `Pair`, `SEATS`,
// `otherSeat` and `setAt` do not apply (index.ts says what of `TwoSeatEngine` fits).
