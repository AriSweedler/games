// Decoders for the engine's shapes (docs/design/briscola-rules.md E20, E21): a `View` arriving in
// a wire `state` frame, a `State` read back from the save and an `Action` from a guest are
// `unknown` until they pass one of these. Built from web/shared/lib/json combinators with the
// fields in types.ts's order, so `JSON.stringify` of a decoded value reproduces the engine's own
// text byte for byte. Structural checks plus the invariants the engine leans on (as many hands
// and piles as seats, the deck's multiset exactly once across hands, stock, trick and piles, the
// trump card under the stock, whole tricks in the piles and whole draws in the stock, a result
// iff the game is over), since a save that disagrees would wedge the game; play legality stays
// with `applyAction`. Hand sizes are checked too (three each while the stock lasts, equal after,
// a card in the trick counting as held) and the leader on turn while the trick is empty: the
// first disagreement leaves a seat to play from an empty hand, the second misrecords the next
// trick's leader. Every card id is refused outside the `LABEL + suit` grammar, every flag outside
// its literals. `count` and `timestamp` are web/shared/lib/game.ts's (DRY round 2 F1); `seat` is
// not: this engine's seats are four (E21).
