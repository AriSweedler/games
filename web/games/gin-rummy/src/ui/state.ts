// The gin app as a reducer over intents (docs/MIGRATION.md step 12; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Module
// boundaries": imported only by main.ts and tests). The legacy multiplayer UI
// (legacy/gin-rummy/index.html) kept one mutable `app` object, wrote the DOM from a hundred
// places and called the network from its handlers. Here `App` is that object as an immutable
// record, plus what the legacy kept in the DOM or in closures (the screen shown, the two waiting
// statuses, the netAttempt ticket, the curtain, the cue machine's memory), split in two as
// backgammon splits it (docs/design/shared-shell.md §4.1, C1): `shell` is the home screen, the
// waiting rooms and the session, the record the shared shell reducer owns since C2
// (web/shared/ui/shell.ts `reduceShell`, over the config `GIN` below: gin's shellConfig.ts half,
// the id, names, tabs, copy, option codec, engine adapters, frames and store, completed here with
// the table hooks the shared flows call: `reset` per site, `rendered`, `refuse`, pass-and-play's
// `viewer`/`revealer`, and the home snapshot's own part); `table` is the hand's own state (the
// tapped card, the ghost slot, the picture, a drag, the sheets, the curtain, the sandbox editor),
// which stays gin's. `Intent` is every handler and every network event, partitioned the same way
// (`SHELL_INTENT_TYPES`), and `reduce` returns the next App with a list of `Effect`s: what to
// persist, toast, send, play or open, as data. main.ts runs the effects through the real adapters
// (`runEffect`: gin's four, then the shared runner) and paints the App (ui/render.ts); the tests
// run the reducer alone. `persist`/`saveFor` and `readHome` are the legacy
// `persist()`/`loadSaved()`/`initHome` reads, through storage.ts, producing the same
// `ginRummyMP_v1` bytes as the captured fixtures (test/parity/gin.state.test.ts).
//
// Gin's residue on the shell (§4.3): the sandbox mode (shown while the first player is named
// `sandbox`, never stored: `GIN_SHELL.modes.parse`, and the fallback to pass-and-play when a
// typed name no longer unlocks it, `withP1Name` after the shell's own step in `reduce`), the
// Score Counter's resume offer (`Resume`'s `scorer` kind, `GIN.home.resume`/`resumeExtra`), and
// the `scorer`/`copy`/`writeSort`/`writeCardBack` effects `runEffect` handles before delegating.
//
// Two legacy traits kept on purpose: the reducer runs `render()`'s state effects wherever the
// legacy called `render()` (the cue machine steps, the screen flips to the table, a selection no
// longer in hand is dropped), and a leave closes the network before the state is reset, so the
// session's own close still raises the "disconnected" toast the legacy raised.
