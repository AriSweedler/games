// the two rules of docs/design/gin-arrangement-and-discards.md: a stock draw cannot be undone (§4,
// `undoDraw`) and a layoff follows the meld that lets more cards follow (§7, layoff.ts); both are
// pinned per leg there.
// `applyAction(state, seat, action, rng, now)` is the reducer: it returns a new State or a
// RuleError worded for the player, never mutates and never throws. Randomness and the clock are
// injected: the legacy defaulted to `Math.random` and read `Date.now()` for `startedAt` and every
// round's `ts`; both are banned here, so callers pass an `Rng` and a `Now`.
