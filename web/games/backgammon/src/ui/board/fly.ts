// A checker's flight between two containers (design §3.9 "Flights", §3.8 "Motion"):
// gin's ghost joined to a FLIP. A move changes the key of two containers (three with a hit), so
// the painter rebuilds them and the moved checker would simply appear at its destination. Before
// the repaint the top checker (or newest slab) of every departure container is measured; after it
// the arrival (the destination's top checker or newest slab) is hidden under `arriving`, a clone
// of the departed checker is fixed over where it stood, laid out, then sent to the arrival's rect
// by one transform (translate plus the scale that turns a checker into a slab, whichever way the
// tray lies) over FLY_MS with a small lift on the way (`fly-lift`: a rise of a few pixels and a
// deeper shadow at mid-flight, a keyframe animation beside the transition, so the glide's own
// end event still ends the flight), and the clone goes when its transition ends or the fallback
// timer fires. Several flights in one repaint leave STAGGER_MS apart (`flightDelays`). A stack
// already five tall keeps its top coin through the repaint (render.ts `ensureStack`: the sixth
// is hidden under it and only the count badge changes), so that coin is not hidden: the clone
// lands on it, and a badge the landing brings waits under `settling` until it does. A hit blot
// waits `HIT_DELAY_MS` before it leaves for the bar, so the mover lands on it first. The
// transition itself is `.flyer`'s in theme.css, so `prefers-reduced-motion` can shorten it; only
// the delay is written inline. Nothing measurable (the page fake) means the repaint alone. The
// module takes ids and rects only: never ui/state.ts, the DOM only through the shared edge.
