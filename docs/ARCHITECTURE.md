# Architecture

Target shape for this repo: two browser games (Gin Rummy, Fidice) as strict, functional
TypeScript, built by Vite, tested by vitest and Playwright, deployed to GitHub Pages by
GitHub Actions, reachable at both `https://arisweedler-at.github.io/hyperagent-web-apps/`
and `https://games.sweedler.com/`. `docs/MIGRATION.md` is the ordered path from today's
two single-file pages to this layout. The refactor is behaviour-preserving: wire messages,
peer-id prefixes, room-code alphabets, localStorage keys and rendered DOM stay identical,
and tests that prove it land before the code they protect.

## Goals

1. Small diffs: adding a game is a folder; adding a feature touches one module and its test.
2. Breakage is caught mechanically: typecheck, lint, unit, protocol, parity and two-peer e2e
   run on every push and PR, and the same typecheck+lint+unit run before every push locally.
3. Online play never regresses: the merge gate plays a real host/guest game in two browser
   contexts through a local PeerServer on both emulated origins; a real-broker game runs on
   every PR (advisory) and nightly against both live origins including a relay-forced game.
4. Engine and domain code is pure, immutable, loop-free and exception-free by tooling, not
   convention.

`dist/` is gitignored. The repo root holds no HTML once `web/` exists.

## Module boundaries and contracts

Enforced by `eslint-plugin-import-x` `no-restricted-paths` zones, `import-x/no-cycle`, and
`tsconfig.pure.json`, which compiles `**/engine`, `**/domain`, `**/bots`, `web/shared/lib` and
both `protocol.ts` files with `lib: ["ES2023"]` and no DOM, so `window`, `document` and
`HTMLElement` are unnameable there by the compiler.

| Layer | May import | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `web/shared/lib` | itself | Leaf modules. `Result<T,E>` (`ok/err/map/andThen`), `Rng = () => number`, `mulberry32`, JSON decoders, `roomCode` constants (`'ginrummy-ari-'`, `'fidice-'`, alphabets). |
| `engine` / `domain` / `bots` | shared/lib, siblings | Pure. `applyAction(state, seat, action, rng): Result<State, RuleError>` (gin), `apply(s, actor, action, rng): Result` (fidice). Return new state; never mutate. `viewFor` / `redactFor` are the only redaction. |
| `protocol.ts` | engine/domain types, shared/lib | Trust boundary. Every inbound frame passes a decoder returning `Result`; outbound frames are built here. Shapes frozen by wire goldens; a future change adds a version field here. |
| `net/` | protocol, engine/domain, `@shared/edge/transport`, `@shared/edge/clock` | Never imports `peerjs`. `Transport`, `Clock`, `Rng`, `NewId` are injected so protocol tests run on `transport.fake.ts`. |
| `ui/` / `view/` | engine/domain types, shared/lib, `@shared/edge/dom` | Render a view to strings/VNodes; DOM writes only in `render.ts` / `vdom.ts`. `HandView { render(model, selection): string }` is the only way a hand is drawn. |
| `storage.ts` / `app/effects.ts` | shared/lib, `@shared/edge/storage` | Only modules that touch localStorage; every read goes through a decoder. |
| `ui/state.ts` / `app/controller.ts` | everything below | Reducer over intents; imported only by `main.ts` and tests. |
| `main.ts` | everything | Constructs adapters (PeerJS, Web Audio, storage, clock, `Math.random`). No logic. Module scripts are deferred, so it boots directly. |
| `*.algorithms.ts` | shared/lib | The only files where loops, `let` and local mutation are allowed. Pure, functions only, 100% line coverage, and each export carries a comment saying why the functional form is unfit (hot DP, node-capped DFS, cartesian enumeration). |

Games never import each other. `infra/` shares only the pure `mapPath()` with tests.

Documented test hooks that are part of the contract: `window.__gin`, `window.__fidice`,
`window.__rng` (a seeded rng installed before boot), `?peer=host:port` (PeerServer override),
`?ice=<url>` (ICE config override).

## Build and serve

Vite 6, `root: 'web'`, `base: './'`, `build.outDir: '../dist'`, `build.target: 'es2022'`,
`build.sourcemap: true`, `modulePreload.polyfill: false`. `rollupOptions.input` is a glob of
`web/**/index.html`, so a new game is picked up by its folder. Output naming keeps each page
self-contained where Rollup allows it and puts anything shared where the proxy already maps it:
`entryFileNames: 'games/[name]/app-[hash].js'` (landing: `app-[hash].js`),
`chunkFileNames` and `assetFileNames`: `'shared/assets/[name]-[hash][extname]'`.
`peerjs@1.5.4` is pinned exactly and bundled from npm; the CDN loaders and `typeof Peer`
polling disappear at each game's cutover.

`legacyPassthrough` (a 30-line plugin in `vite.config.ts`) copies `legacy/<g>/index.html` and
`legacy/shared/ice.js` into `dist` after the bundle for every page listed in `LEGACY_PAGES`,
overwriting Vite's output for that path. Cutting a page over is deleting it from that list and
deleting its legacy file; rollback is reverting that commit. The e2e `next` project builds
with `LEGACY_PAGES=` so a ported page is exercised end-to-end before it is flipped.

Deploy: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` job `deploy` runs only on push to `main`, `needs: [check, e2e]`,
`permissions: {contents: read, pages: write, id-token: write}`, `concurrency: {group: pages}`,
steps `actions/configure-pages@v5`, `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 {path: dist}`,
`actions/deploy-pages@v4`, and prints both served URLs in the job summary. One-time console
setting: Settings > Pages > Source = GitHub Actions. Nothing generated is committed.

## Two origins

Every URL Vite writes is document-relative because `base` is `'./'`. From
`/hyperagent-web-apps/games/fidice/` a page requests `./app-x.js` and `../../shared/assets/y.js`;
from `/fidice/` on games.sweedler.com the same strings resolve to `/fidice/app-x.js` (mapped by
the Worker's catch-all to `/hyperagent-web-apps/games/fidice/app-x.js`) and `/shared/assets/y.js`
(mapped by its `/shared/` rule). No JS computes a base path; share links already use
`location.origin + location.pathname`. Nothing may be emitted to a root `/assets/`. Guards:

1. `test/dist/asset-urls.test.ts`: every `src`/`href`/`url()` in dist HTML and CSS is
   `./`-relative, `../../shared/`-relative or `https://`; never `/`-rooted.
2. `test/dist/check-dist-paths.test.ts`: resolves each reference against both bases, feeds the
   proxy-origin path through `mapPath()` exported from `infra/games-proxy/worker.js`, and asserts
   the target exists in dist.
3. `no-restricted-syntax` bans string literals starting with `/hyperagent-web-apps` or `/shared`.
4. Playwright runs every spec on project `pages` (`tools/serve-dist.ts`, dist mounted at
   `/hyperagent-web-apps/` on :4173) and project `proxy` (`tools/proxy-dev.ts` on :8787 running the
   real `worker.js` fetch handler with `UPSTREAM=http://127.0.0.1:4173`).

localStorage stays per-origin (unchanged). Peer ids are origin-independent, so a github.io host
and a games.sweedler.com guest still meet on the broker.

## Enforcement toolchain

### tsconfig.base.json

`strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitOverride`,
`noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`,
`isolatedModules`, `noImplicitReturns`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`,
`allowUnreachableCode: false`, `allowUnusedLabels: false`, `useUnknownInCatchVariables`,
`forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`, `module: ESNext`, `moduleResolution: Bundler`,
`allowImportingTsExtensions` (imports use explicit `.ts` specifiers so `node --experimental-strip-types`
can run `tools/*.ts` unchanged), `target: ES2022`, `lib` per project (web: ES2023+DOM+DOM.Iterable;
pure: ES2023; node: ES2023 + `types: ["node"]`), `noEmit`, `skipLibCheck`. During migration only:
`allowJs: true, checkJs: false` in `tsconfig.web.json`, removed in the last step; a ratchet test
asserts the count of `.js` files under `web/` never increases.

### eslint.config.js

Base for all `.ts`: `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked` + `stylisticTypeChecked` with
`parserOptions.projectService`. Added: `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: error`,
`switch-exhaustiveness-check: [error, {requireDefaultForNonUnion: true}]`,
`consistent-type-definitions: [error, 'type']`, `no-non-null-assertion: error`,
`explicit-module-boundary-types: error`, `consistent-type-imports: error`; core
`prefer-const`, `no-var`, `no-param-reassign: [error, {props: true}]`.

`no-restricted-syntax: error` entries: `ForStatement`, `ForInStatement`, `ForOfStatement`,
`WhileStatement`, `DoWhileStatement` ("no raw loops: use map/filter/reduce/flatMap/Array.from or
a named algorithm in *.algorithms.ts"); `TSEnumDeclaration`, `TSParameterProperty`,
`TSModuleDeclaration` (unsupported by Node type stripping, and enums are not erasable);
`LabeledStatement`; `Literal[value=/^\/(hyperagent-web-apps|shared)\//]` ("no absolute site paths");
`MemberExpression[object.name=Math][property.name=random]` outside `main.ts` and `web/shared/edge`
("inject Rng").

`eslint-plugin-functional` v7. ON everywhere under `web/`: `no-loop-statements` (redundant with
the syntax ban on purpose: two messages, one intent), `no-let: [error, {allowInForLoopInit: false}]`,
`immutable-data: [error, {ignoreImmediateMutation: true, ignoreClasses: false}]` (lets
`[...xs].sort()` through), `prefer-immutable-types` (`ReadonlyShallow` for parameters,
`None` for return types and variables to keep inference readable), `type-declaration-immutability`
(`ReadonlyShallow`, `AtLeast`, all identifiers), `prefer-property-signatures`, `readonly-type: generic`.
ON only in pure dirs (`engine`, `domain`, `bots`, `web/shared/lib`, both `protocol.ts`):
`no-throw-statements`, `no-try-statements`, `no-classes`, `no-this-expressions`,
`no-expression-statements: [error, {ignoreVoid: true}]` (warn until the tightening step, tracked by
a ratchet on the warning count), `no-return-void`. OFF with reasons: `no-conditional-statements`
(the owner asked for no raw loops, not no branches; early returns beat nested ternaries in
reducers), `functional-parameters` (bans zero-arity thunks that DOM callbacks need),
`prefer-tacit` (collides with `unbound-method`, hurts stack traces), `no-mixed-types` (VNode and
deps records mix data and callbacks legitimately), `no-promise-reject` (ICE and transport loaders
reject). Overrides: `**/*.algorithms.ts` turns off the loop ban, `no-let`, `immutable-data`,
`prefer-immutable-types`; edges (`main.ts`, `**/app/**`, `**/net/{host,guest,client,session}.ts`,
`**/view/vdom.ts`, `web/shared/edge/**`) keep the loop ban and readonly types but turn off
`no-classes`, `no-this-expressions`, `no-let`, `immutable-data`, `no-expression-statements`,
`no-return-void`, `no-throw-statements`, `no-try-statements`; `**/*.test.ts`, `e2e/**`, `tools/**`
get `strictTypeChecked` only plus `no-console: off`; `legacy/**` and `test/fixtures/legacy/**` are
ignored. `eslint-plugin-import-x`: `no-restricted-paths` zones per the table above, `no-cycle`.
`eslint-config-prettier` last; Prettier formats. Lint runs with `--max-warnings 0` except the
tracked `no-expression-statements` warnings during migration.

### Git hooks

Plain files under `.githooks/`, installed by `npm run hooks` (= `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`),
also wired as the `prepare` script so `npm ci` installs them. No husky, no lefthook: both flip
`core.hooksPath` or overwrite `.git/hooks/*`, and the owner's template pre-commit must keep running.
Verified on git 2.55 in this repo: with `core.hooksPath` set, `git rev-parse --git-path hooks`
returns `.githooks`, so the shim must use `--git-dir`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# .githooks/pre-commit: chain the template hook (big-file + trailing-whitespace checks).
t="$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/hooks/pre-commit"
[ -x "$t" ] && exec "$t" "$@" </dev/tty
exit 0
```

`exec` with `/dev/tty` on stdin because the template hook uses `read -n 1` prompts.
`.githooks/pre-push` runs `npm run check` (typecheck, lint, unit; same commands as CI job `check`)
and prints `npm ci` if `node_modules` is missing. `npm run hooks:verify` fails if `core.hooksPath`
is not `.githooks` or `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is missing, and runs in CI as a repo-local sanity check
of the shim script itself (`sh -n`).

### GitHub Actions

`ci.yml` on `push` and `pull_request`. Job `check`: checkout, `setup-node@v4 {node-version-file:
.nvmrc, cache: npm}`, `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck` (`tsc -b`), `npm run lint` (eslint + prettier
--check), `npm test -- --coverage`, `npm run build`, dist tests, upload `dist`. Job `e2e` (needs
check): download dist, `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`, `npm run test:e2e`
(projects pages + proxy + next; PeerServer from the `peer` package on :9000; retries 1; trace on
first retry; report uploaded). Job `broker` (needs check, `continue-on-error: true`): the two-peer
specs without `?peer=` through 0.peerjs.com, so signalling regressions surface at review without
blocking on a third party. Job `deploy` as above. Branch protection on `main` requires `check` and
`e2e`. `nightly.yml` runs the online specs against both live origins through the real broker and
`turn.sweedler.com`, plus one game with `iceTransportPolicy: 'relay'` forced via `?ice=`, and opens
or updates a pinned issue on failure.

## Testing pyramid

1. Unit (vitest, colocated `*.test.ts`): engine/domain table tests (the 22-deadwood two-arrangement
   hand, chained 6S/10S/QS layoff, every `applyAction` branch, tie-at-target -> seat 0; the 252-row
   ladder, `apply` phase gates, `redactFor`, `survivalFor` spot values, every strategy's `decide()`
   over seeded views), property tests via `legalActions` (300 seeded games: 52-card conservation,
   hand sizes 10/11, totals monotone, termination), pure UI helpers, scorer maths, `ice.ts` with a
   fetch parameter. Coverage: 90% lines on engine/domain/bots, 100% on `*.algorithms.ts` (with
   direct tests of the 300k node cap and the 400-entry cache eviction).
2. Protocol: decoders reject malformed and hostile frames (wrong `t`, out-of-range rank/die,
   oversized names, prototype-pollution keys) with the strings fidice already echoes; wire goldens
   recorded from the legacy pages decode AND re-encode byte-for-byte after `ts` masking; host/guest
   sessions over `transport.fake.ts` + `fakeClock` replay every recorded sequence; frozen-constant
   tests for prefixes, alphabets, storage keys and `t` tags.
3. Parity (permanent): `describe.each([['legacy', gin-engine.cjs], ['current', engine]])` runs the
   same assertions on both; 1000 seeded gin games and 200 seeded fidice games replay through both
   with state and views deep-equal (known defects preserved and named); DOM-snapshot parity
   (normalised innerHTML of `#hand`, `#actions`, `#statusBanner`, `#oppCards`, `#rrBody`, `#app` over
   ~60 recorded views); computed-style goldens (~60 selectors at 390x844 and 1280x800) recorded
   before any CSS moves; a seeded 3-bot fidice game log golden. `npm run replay`
   (`node --experimental-strip-types tools/replay-goldens.ts`) runs the replays without npm.
4. E2E (Playwright, two contexts, Chromium with `--disable-features=WebRtcHideLocalIpsWithMdns
   --no-first-run`, `window.__rng` seeded via `addInitScript`): gin online (join, deal, scripted
   turns, both DOMs agree, host reload -> resume, guest rejoin), gin local (curtain to a knock),
   gin scorer (CSV blob), fidice online (lobby, hello, seeded bots, redaction, spectator), fidice
   bots to `over`; smoke on every page: zero uncaught exceptions, zero failed requests outside an
   allowlist, and the Peer constructor received the `?ice=` config. Visual `toHaveScreenshot`
   baselines captured on the CI runner from the legacy pages.

## Conventions for small diffs

- New game: `web/games/<g>/{index.html, main.ts, theme.css, src/}` plus tests; nothing in `web/shared`
  changes. Vite picks up the folder; the proxy needs no change; e2e gets one spec per mode.
- New rule or action: add the variant to the `Action` union in `engine/types.ts`, the reducer branch
  in `game.ts` (exhaustiveness check fails until every switch handles it), the codec case in
  `protocol.ts`, a table test and a recorded golden. Wire-visible changes add a version field.
- New screen or CSS class: add it to `CONTRACT.md`; `class-contract.test.ts` fails when a class
  toggled in TS has no CSS rule or vice versa.
- Behaviour change: a PR that flips a golden says so in its body and touches only that golden.
- Anything needing a loop goes into the game's `*.algorithms.ts` with a reason comment and a test.

## Seams reserved for the roadmap (not implemented now)

- Shared design tokens / UI kit: `web/shared/styles/tokens.css` (nearly empty now; the two games'
  `:root` blocks disagree on `--felt`) and `web/shared/ui/` (README only). The Fidice restyle maps
  its palette onto shared token names in `theme.css`, then moves screen builders into `shared/ui`;
  computed-style goldens and the class contract gate it.
- Swappable hand display: `ui/hand/HandView.ts` is the interface `render.ts` consumes; a new view is
  a second module and a `main.ts` choice, gated by DOM-snapshot parity of the default.
- Phone layout stability: `ui/fit.ts` isolates `nextScale()` as a pure function over measured sizes
  so the layout-thrash loop can be replaced without touching `render.ts`.
- Generic host/client session and code-entry/toast/lobby builders: extracted from fidice's
  `HostSession`/`ClientSession` into `web/shared` only after both games are typed and parity-locked,
  behind the existing wire goldens.
