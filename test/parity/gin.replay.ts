// Full-game parity for the gin engine (docs/MIGRATION.md step 10; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Testing
// pyramid", parity): seeded random legal play on BOTH legs at once, the legacy fixture and the
// TypeScript engine, each fed its own copy of the same mulberry32 stream. The policy reads the
// legacy view; the chosen action is applied to both legs, and after every action the full state
// (wall-clock fields zeroed), `viewFor` for both seats and `legalActions` for both seats must be
// the same JSON text: same values, same keys, same key order.
//
// The corpus is seeds 1..GAMES, split into SHARDS equal ranges so vitest runs them on SHARDS
// workers at once: `gin.replay.<n>.test.ts` is one line, `replayShard(n)`. Each shard asserts the
// outcome coverage and the lastDrawn leak over its own range.
// GIN_REPLAY_GAMES overrides the game count for a quicker local run (CI runs the default 1000).
