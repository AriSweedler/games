# legacy/: frozen oracle sources

The three files beside this README are the pre-migration site exactly as it was served before
`docs/MIGRATION.md` began: the two self-contained game pages and the classic `shared/ice.js` ICE
loader they both used. They are **test fixtures**, frozen at each page's cutover (Fidice in step 7,
Gin Rummy in step 13), and they are **never edited**: `test/fixtures/legacy/manifest.test.ts`
re-runs the extractors against them on every `npm test` and fails if a pinned range or a fixture
changes (`test/fixtures/legacy/MANIFEST.json` holds the sha256 of each range and fixture), and
`test/fixtures/legacy/frozen.test.ts` pins the sha256 of each whole file and the directory listing,
so a byte change anywhere in the three files (or a fourth file here) fails the suite; lint,
Prettier and the Vite build ignore the directory.

**Nothing serves them.** Since step 13 `dist/` holds only what Vite builds from `web/`: both game
pages are the TypeScript ports, `dist/shared/ice.js` no longer exists, and the passthrough plugin
that once copied these files into `dist/` is gone. The one place a legacy page is loaded in a
browser is the DOM-parity oracle below, on the test harness alone.

The parity suites under `test/parity/` run the typed modules beside the fixtures cut from these
pages (`describe.each([legacy, current])`); `web/games/**` headers cite the page line ranges each
module was ported from. If an oracle ever has to move, regenerate with `npm run fixtures:legacy`
(and `fixtures:gin-wire`, `fixtures:gin-storage`, `debundle:fidice` as applicable) and say why in
the PR; do not touch these files.
