// The relay-forced game (docs/MIGRATION.md step 15, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "CI"): host and guest
// open gin with `?ice-policy=relay` and an ICE list naming the harness's own TURN relay (coturn on
// PORTS.turn, started by playwright.config.ts), so every ICE candidate must go through that relay,
// and the game still joins, deals and toasts "Connected via relay" on both sides; the selected
// candidate pair, read off the RTCPeerConnection, says so too. Hermetic: it plays on every PR, and
// skips only where coturn is not installed (until issue #19 the relay was turn.sweedler.com and the
// nightly the one place this could run; now the nightly, E2E_TARGET=deployed, plays this same spec
// with the deployed gin page and this same local relay). The hook itself is also proven alone
// below, and in web/shared/edge/ice.test.ts and transport.test.ts: a page opened with it hands PeerJS
// `iceTransportPolicy: 'relay'`, asserted the moment the room is registered, with no join attempted.
